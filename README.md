# Travel_Recommendation
A Travel Recommendation based on social media connections where user share their reviews on the cities and share reviwed cities with their connections. 
Here I have explored social media analytics, In we can measure the simlarity between two person and find stonger connectionn who have shared more cities or visited more cities. 
Also I have credted a algorithm which gives optimal path between a source city, shared city and destination { source -> shared city(s) -> destination }.
Here optimal path is based on two parameters :- 1) Time of traveling and 2) Cost of traveling. It gives large choice to user whether they want economical journey or faster journey.

Feel free to explore the codes, improve it if any error or bugs you find.
